\h1{How to install shttpd}

shttpd comes with NO WARRANTY.

\h2{System requirements}
shttpd works only under UNIX.

Optional testing requires user accounts \tt{shttp} and \tt{shttplog}.

\h2{Installation}
Download the shttpd package.  The most recent shttpd package is
\a{shttpd-\version.tar.gz}{shttpd~\version}.

Unpack the shttpd package:
<pre>
  gunzip shttpd-\version.tar
  tar -xf shttpd-\version.tar
  cd shttpd-\version
</pre>

Compile the shttpd programs:
<pre>
  make
</pre>

As root, run some tests.  The tests assume the existence of the
accounts \tt{shttp} and \tt{shttplog}, for running and logging
output from shttpd daemons, respectively.  Create these accounts now,
or skip the tests.  Normally, the tests produce no output:
<pre>
  make test
</pre>
If the tests fail, manually compare their output with the expected results:
<pre>
  ./rts &gt;rts.out
  diff rts.out rts.exp
</pre>

As root, install the shttpd programs under \tt{/usr/local/shttpd}:
<pre>
  make setup check
</pre>

Report successful installation:
<pre>
  ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \\
  | mail web-inst@superscript.com
</pre>
replacing \tt{First M. Last} with your name.
