== NAME
cgi-config - configure an instance of cgi-httpd

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
cgi-config !user! !loguser! !dir! !port! !prog!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 

The +cgi-config+ program configures an instance of +cgi-httpd+ to run as
+!user!+ and log as +!loguser!+, listen on TCP port +!port!+ (a name from
+/etc/services+ or a numeric value), and run +!prog!+ (all remaining
arguments) for each valid cgi request.

The +cgi-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!+ (an absolute path) as
an http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html[svscan]-format service directory.

The +cgi-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!/env+ containing files
that establish runtime environment variables for +cgi-httpd+ via
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[envdir].

The +cgi-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!/root+ for +cgi-httpd+ to
use as its root directory.  It also creates +!dir!/root/bin+ to hold cgi
executable files, and +!dir!/root/host+ to hold the per-host working
directories.
