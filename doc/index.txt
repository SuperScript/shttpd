== What Is shttpd?
The +echo-httpd+, +redir-httpd+, and +cgi-httpd+ programs are HTTP daemons
designed to complement publicfile.

The +echo-httpd+ program echos HTTP requests.

The +echo-config+ program configures +echo-httpd+.

The +redir-httpd+ program redirects HTTP requests via cdb lookup.

The +redir-config+ program configures +redir-httpd+.

The +cgi-httpd+ and +cgiuser-httpd+ programs execute a cgi script.

The +cgi-config+ and +cgiuser-config+ programs configure +cgi-httpd+ and
+cgiuser-httpd+, respectively.

The +cgi-dispatch+ program executes a CGI program specified by the environment variable
+PATH_INFO+.

The +constant-httpd+ program prints the same file for each HTTP request.

The +constant-config+ program configures +constant-httpd+.

Each instance of an shttpd daemon listens on a separate address, in a
+chroot+ directory (except for +cgiuser-httpd+), typically running as a
nonprivileged user.
