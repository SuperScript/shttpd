\h1{The \tt{cgi-dispatch} program}

\h2{Interface}
<pre>
  cgi-dispatch
</pre>

\tt{cgi-dispatch} executes the program \tt{./bin/\it{prog}}, where
\ti{prog} is the value of the CGI environment variable \tt{PATH_INFO}.
\tt{cgi-dispatch} is intended to be run under
\a{cgi-httpd.html}{\tt{cgi-httpd}} or
\a{cgiuser-httpd.html}{\tt{cgiuser-httpd}}.

Before executing the program, \tt{cgi-dispatch} replaces \tt{//} with \tt{/}
and \tt{/.} with \tt{/:} in the program path.

If it encounters an error in processing a request, \tt{cgi-dispatch} exits 21.
If it cannot find the requested program, \tt{cgi-dispatch} issues an error
response and exits 0.  Otherwise, it returns the exit code of \ti{prog}.

\h2{Running under \tt{cgi-shttpd}}
Configure a server to run \tt{cgi-dispatch} under \tt{cgi-shttpd} in the
directory \tt{ROOT}.  Copy \tt{cgi-dispatch} to \tt{ROOT/bin}.  Copy programs
you want \tt{cgi-dispatch} to run for requests to \ti{host} into the
directory \tt{ROOT/\it{host}/bin}.
