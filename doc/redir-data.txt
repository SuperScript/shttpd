== NAME
redir-data - construct a redirect cdb from the file data

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
redir-data
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +redir-data+ program creates the cdb-format file +data.cdb+ from
information in the file +data+ for use by
link:redir-httpd.html[+redir-httpd+].  It may use other files with names
beginning with +data+.  The update to +data.cdb+ occurs atomically.

=== Data Format

Each redirection command in +data+ consists of a single line with two
+\#+-separated fields.  The first field is a request path, and the second
field is the replacement for that request path.  Additional +#+ characters
may appear in the replacement field.

A request path ending in '+/+' permits +redir-httpd+ to form a partial match.
The corresponding replacement field must also end in '+/+'.  An exact matches
is preferred, as is the longest partial match.

== EXAMPLES 
Commands specifying the following substitutions
!!!!
/shttpd  --> http://www.superscript.com/shttpd/fubar.html
/shttpd/ --> http://www.superscript.com/shttpd/
!!!!
result in the following redirections:
!!!!
/shttpd --> http://www.superscript.com/shttpd/fubar.html
/shttpd/cgi-httpd.html --> http://www.superscript.com/shttpd/cgi-httpd.html
!!!!
