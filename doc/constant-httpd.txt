== NAME
constant-httpd - serve a file in response to http requests

== NAME
!!!!
constant-httpd !file!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +constant-httpd+ program reads an HTTP request message from standard input,
and prints +!file!+ in response.

Before reading any input, +constant-httpd+ changes the working directory to
that named in the +$ROOT+ environment variable, performs +chroot+ to the
current directory, and then sets its group id and user id to the numeric
values given in the environment variables +$GID+ and +$UID+, typically set
with http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[+envdir+].  If it cannot carry
out these operations, +constant-httpd+ complains to standard output and
exits{nbsp}111.  If the +!file!+ argument is missing it silently
exits{nbsp}100.

If it encounters an error in reading +!file!+, +constant-httpd+
exits{nbsp}23.  If it encounters another error processing a request,
+constant-httpd+ exits{nbsp}21.  Otherwise, it exits{nbsp}0.

The +constant-httpd+ program accepts HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1
requests.  For a request with the host name +!host!+, +constant-httpd+ looks
for +./!host!/!file!+, after replacing +/.+ with +/:+ and +//+ with +/+ in
+./!host!/!file!+.  For a valid request lacking a host name, +constant-httpd+
uses +0+ as the host name.

If the environment variable +$REQUESTHOST+ is set, then +constant-httpd+ uses
its value as +!host!+, overriding any host given in the request.
