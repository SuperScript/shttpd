== NAME
echo-httpd - echo a cgi request

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
echo-httpd
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +echo-httpd+ program reads an HTTP request message from standard input,
adds a header, and prints the result to standard output.

Before reading any input, +echo-httpd+ changes the working
directory to that named in the +$ROOT+ environment variable,
performs +chroot+ to the current directory, and then sets its
group id and user id to the numeric values given in the environment
variables +$GID+ and +$UID+, typically set with
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[+envdir+].
If it cannot carry out these operations, +echo-httpd+ complains to
standard output and exits{nbsp}111.  The +echo-httpd+ program opens no files.

If it encounters a temporary error in processing a request,
+echo-httpd+ exits{nbsp}21.  Otherwise, it exits{nbsp}0.

The +echo-httpd+ program is a debugging tool and not a proper http daemon.  It
does not parse the request message, and handles any request, no matter how
severely deformed.
