\h1{The \tt{redir-data} program}

\h2{Interface}
<pre>
  redir-data
</pre>

\tt{redir-data} creates the cdb-format file \tt{data.cdb} from information in
the file \tt{data} for use by \a{redir-httpd.html}{\tt{redir-httpd}}.  It
may use other files with names beginning with \tt{data}.  The update to
\tt{data.cdb} occurs atomically.

\h2{Data format}

Each redirection command in \tt{data} consists of a single line with two
'\tt{#}'-separated fields.  The first field is a request path, and the second
field is the replacement for that request path.  Additional '\tt{#}'
characters may appear in the replacement field.

A request path ending in '\tt{/}' permits \tt{redir-httpd} to form a partial
match.  The corresponding replacement field must also end in '\tt{/}'.
An exact matches is preferred, as is the longest partial match.
