== NAME
constant-config - configure an instance of constant-httpd

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
constant-config !user! !loguser! !dir! !port! +!file!+
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 

The +constant-config+ program configures an instance of +constant-httpd+ to
run as +!user!+ and log as +!loguser!+, listen on TCP port +!port!+ (a name
from +/etc/services+ or a numeric value), and run +!prog!+ (all remaining
arguments) for each valid cgi request.

The +constant-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!+ (an absolute path)
as an http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html[svscan]-format service
directory.

The +constant-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!/env+ containing
files that establish runtime environment variables for +constant-httpd+ via
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[envdir].  It creates an empty
+!dir!/env/REQUESTHOST+, causing +constant-httpd+ to respect the host named in
each request.  To force +constant-httpd+ to use a particular host name,
overriding the host obtained from a request, edit +!dir!/env/REQUESTHOST+
after running +constant-config+.

The +constant-config+ program creates the directory +!dir!/root+ for
+constant-httpd+ to use as its root directory.
