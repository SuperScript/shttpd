== NAME
cgiuser-httpd - handle cgi requests

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
cgiuser-httpd !prog!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +cgiuser-httpd+ program reads an HTTP request standard input.  It request
header, sets up the environment, prints initial response headers, and execs
its argument tail +!prog!+ with the body of the message on standard input, and
standard output pointing to the network.

Before reading any input, +cgiuser-httpd+ changes the working directory to
that named in the +$ROOT+ environment variable, and then sets its group id
and user id to the numeric values given in the environment variables +$GID+
and +$UID+, typically set with
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[+envdir+].  Before executing
+!prog!+, +cgiuser-httpd+ sets the execution path to +/bin:/usr/bin+.
If it cannot carry out these operations, +cgiuser-httpd+ complains to
standard output and exits 111.

If it encounters an error in processing a request, +cgi-httpd+ exits{nbsp}21.
Otherwise, it returns the exit code of +!prog!+.

For a request specifying the hostname +!H!+, +cgiuser-httpd+
changes its working directory to +./host/!H!+ after replacing
+/.+  with +/:+ and +//+ with +/+ in
+./host/!H!+.  When a valid request lacks a host name,
+cgiuser-httpd+ uses +0+ as the host name.  After changing the
working directory, +cgiuser-httpd+ sets the cgi environment variables
and executes +!prog!+.

The +cgiuser-httpd+ program accepts HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1 requests.
It supports HEAD, GET, and POST, and rejects all other methods.
It sets environment variables for +!prog!+ as follows:

+$AUTH_TYPE+::
Unset.

+$CONTENT_LENGTH+::
The content length of the request, if applicable, or unset.

+$CONTENT_TYPE+::
The content type of the request, if applicable, or unset.

+$GATEWAY_INTERFACE+::
The string +CGI/1.1+

+$PATH_INFO+::
The path portion of the request URI, after URL decoding.

+$PATH_TRANSLATED+::
Unset.

+$QUERY_STRING+::
The query string portion of the request URI.

+$REMOTE_ADDR+::
The value of the environment variable +$TCPREMOTEIP+.

+$REMOTE_HOST+::
The value of the environment variable +$TCPREMOTEHOST+.

+$REMOTE_USER+::
The value of the environment variable +$TCPREMOTEINFO+.

+$REQUEST_METHOD+::
The method of the request URI.

+$SCRIPT_NAME+::
The empty string.

+$SERVER_NAME+::
The name of the host given in the request, if applicable, and +0+ otherwise.

+$SERVER_PORT+::
The value of the environment variable +$TCPLOCALPORT+.

+$SERVER_PROTOCOL+::
One of the strings +HTTP/0.9+, +HTTP/1.0+, or +HTTP/1.1+.

+$SERVER_SOFTWARE+::
