== NAME
redir-httpd - issue a redirect in response to a cgi request

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
redir-httpd
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +redir-httpd+ program reads an HTTP request message from standard input,
looks up the URI in a cdb-format database, and prints a redirect response or
an error response to standard output.

Before reading any input, +redir-httpd+ changes the working
directory to that named in the +$ROOT+ environment variable,
performs +chroot+ to the current directory, and then sets its
group id and user id to the numeric values given in the environment
variables +$GID+ and +$UID+, typically set with
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html[+envdir+].
If it cannot carry out these operations, +redir-httpd+ complains
to standard error and exit{nbsp}111.

If it encounters an error in processing a request, +redir-httpd+
exit{nbsp}21.  Otherwise, it exit{nbsp}0.

The +redir-httpd+ program accepts HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1 requests.
For a request with the host name +!host!+, +redir-httpd+ replaces +/.+ with
+/:+ and +//+ with +/+ in +./!host!+, and then looks for redirection commands
in the file +./!host!/data.cdb+, created by
link:redir-data.html[+redir-data+].  For a valid request lacking a host name,
+redir-httpd+ uses +0+ as the host name.

=== Request Path Resolution

Starting immediately to the left of any query string in the request path, and
moving from right to left, +redir-httpd+ splits the request path at each +/+
character to obtain +!head!/!tail!+, and and attempts a cdb lookup using
+!head!/+ as the key.  Upon success, +redir-httpd+ replaces +!head!/+ with the
lookup result, appends +!tail!+, and redirects the client to the resultant
URL.  When +redir-httpd+ receives a request with an empty path, it uses +/+
instead.

If the full request path (sans query string) ends with a character other than
+/+, then +redir-httpd+ first attempts a lookup using the full request path as
the key.

=== Logging

When it processes a request without error, +redir-httpd+ prints to standard
error a line with the form
!!!!
!host! !ref! !match! !key! !value!
!!!!
The string +!host!+ is the request host name.  The string +!ref!+ is the value
of the first +Referer:+ header, or +0+ if there is no such header.  The string
+!match!+ is +unknown+ if no match is found, +partial+ for a partial path
match, or +exact+ for an exact path match.  The string +!key!+ is the portion
of the request path that matched a redirection command, or the full request
path when +!match!+ is +unknown+.  The string +!value!+ is the replacement for
+!key!+ in the relevant redirection command, or the empty string when
+!match!+ is +unknown+.

Within each component of the log line, +redir-httpd+ replaces control
characters with '+?+' and spaces with '+_+'.  If a component exceeds 100
characters in length, +redir-httpd+ truncates it to 100 characters and appends
ellipses.
