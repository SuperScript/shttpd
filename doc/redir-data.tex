\chapter{The \cmd{redir-data} program}

\section{Interface}
\begin{code}
  redir-data
\end{code}

\cmd{redir-data} creates the cdb-format file \cmd{data.cdb} from information in
the file \cmd{data} for use by \href{\cmd{redir-httpd}}{redir-httpd.html}.  It
may use other files with names beginning with \cmd{data}.  The update to
\cmd{data.cdb} occurs atomically.

\section{Data format}

Each redirection command in \cmd{data} consists of a single line with two
'\cmd{\#}'-separated fields.  The first field is a request path, and the second
field is the replacement for that request path.  Additional '\cmd{\#}'
characters may appear in the replacement field.

A request path ending in '\cmd{/}' permits \cmd{redir-httpd} to form a partial
match.  The corresponding replacement field must also end in '\cmd{/}'.
An exact matches is preferred, as is the longest partial match.
