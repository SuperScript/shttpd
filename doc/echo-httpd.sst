<pre>
  echo-httpd
</pre>

\tt{echo-httpd} reads an HTTP request message from standard input,
adds a header, and prints the result to standard output.

Before reading any input, \tt{echo-httpd} changes the working
directory to that named in the \tt{$ROOT} environment variable,
performs \tt{chroot} to the current directory, and then sets its
group id and user id to the numeric values given in the environment
variables \tt{$GID} and \tt{$UID}, typically set with
\a{http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html}{\tt{envdir}}.
If it cannot carry out these operations, \tt{echo-httpd} complains to
standard output and exits 111.  \tt{echo-httpd} opens no files.

If it encounters a temporary error in processing a request,
\tt{echo-httpd} exits 21.  Otherwise, it exits 0.

\tt{echo-httpd} is a debugging tool, and not a proper http daemon.
It does not parse the request message, and handles any request, no
matter how severely deformed.
