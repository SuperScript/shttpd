= How to install shttpd

== System requirements
The {package} package works only under UNIX.

Running regression tests requires user accounts +shttp+ and +shttplog+.

== Installation
Download the shttpd package.  The most recent shttpd package is
link:{package}-{version}.tar.gz[{version}].

Unpack the shttpd package:
!!!!
gunzip {package}-{version}.tar
tar -xf {package}-{version}.tar
cd {package}-{version}
!!!!

Compile the shttpd programs:
!!!!
make
!!!!

As root, run some tests.  The tests assume the existence of the accounts
+shttp+ and +shttplog+, for running and logging output from shttpd daemons,
respectively.  Create these accounts, or skip the tests.  Normally, the tests
produce no output:
!!!!
make test
!!!!
If the tests fail, manually compare their output with the expected results:
!!!!
./rts > rts.out
diff rts.out rts.exp
!!!!

As root, install the shttpd programs under +/usr/local/shttpd+:
!!!!
make setup check
!!!!

Report successful installation:
!!!!
  ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
  | mail web-inst@superscript.com
!!!!
replacing +First M. Last+ with your name.
