\h1{The \tt{cgi-config} program}

\h2{Interface}
<pre>
  cgi-config \it{user} \it{loguser} \it{dir} \it{port} \it{prog}
</pre>
where \ti{user} and \ti{loguser} are system account names,
\ti{dir} is an absolute path name, and \ti{port} is a TCP port,
and \ti{prog} is one or more arguments specifying a program to run
for each valid cgi request.  The port may be specified as a name from
\tt{/etc/services} or a numeric value.

\tt{cgi-config} creates the directory \ti{dir} as an
\a{http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html}{svscan}-format service
directory, configured to run \tt{cgi-httpd} on the TCP port
\ti{port}, running \tt{cgi-httpd} as \ti{user} and creating log
files as \ti{loguser}, and executing \ti{prog} for each cgi
request it receives.

\tt{cgi-config} creates the directory \tt{\it{dir}/env}
containing files that establish runtime environment variables for
\tt{cgi-httpd} via \a{http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html}{envdir}.

\tt{cgi-config} creates the directory \tt{\it{dir}/root} for
\tt{cgi-httpd} to use as its root directory.  \tt{cgi-config} also
creates \tt{\it{dir}/root/bin} to hold cgi executable files, and
\tt{\it{dir}/root/host} to hold the per-host working directories.
